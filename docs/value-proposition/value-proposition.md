## The problem

Since the introduction of the residents' parking zone in the vicinity of the HWR, employees of the university have had problems parking their cars. The university provides parking spaces. However, there are only a limited number of parking spaces offered by the university, so not every employee can park when they come to work. Additionally, the administrative workload is pretty high considering the task at hand. 

## Our solution

We want to create a software solution to increase the efficiency of parking lots, by creating a comprehensive solution to make booking parking spaces for the HWR, and for that matter, any other organization. We strive to create a web-app based approach to a streamlined process for booking parking lots in advance. 


## Target user
The target user would be organisations with limited access to parking lots, and by extension, the workers and visitors thereof.
